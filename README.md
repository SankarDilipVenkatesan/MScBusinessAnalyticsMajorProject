EFFECTIVENESS OF IRELAND'S RENEWABLE ENERGY STRATEGY: A HISTORICAL REVIEW AND FUTURE OUTLOOK


This report presents an analysis of Ireland's energy sector, focusing on analyzing renewable and non-renewable energy production, total energy consumption, the Building Energy Rating (BER) of construction on energy efficiency, and a forecast for sustainable energy usage. The study analyses historical data to evaluate the influence of government interventions on the growth of renewable energy sources in production and adoption by consumers across different sectors. 

Descriptive analyses and a predictive model are employed to determine the trajectory of renewable energy production and consumption and assess the feasibility of meeting future renewable energy goals set by the Irish Government. 

The findings of this study, may inform policymakers and stakeholders about the effectiveness of current policies and influence future strategies for promoting renewable energy.
